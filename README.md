# MapSlabFlask

## Overview

MapSlabFlask is an advanced online interface that extends the capabilities of previous hyperspectral data analysis projects. It builds upon XRC and XRF data obtained from paintings and pictorial artworks, providing a powerful platform for creating and manipulating maps. This software is tailored to assist professionals in art restoration, museums, and chemical analysis in detecting historical changes, identifying forgeries, and more.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Hyperspectral Data Analysis:** Utilizes XRC and XRF data to generate detailed hyperspectral maps of artworks.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive online interface designed for the convenience of art restoration professionals, museum staff, and chemists.

## How to Use

1. **Upload Artwork Data:** Import hyperspectral data (XRC, XRF) of the artwork for analysis.

2. **Generate Hyperspectral Maps:** Use the tool to create detailed hyperspectral maps, providing insights into the artwork's composition.

3. **Analyze Temporal Changes:** Explore time-dependent changes in the artwork, identifying alterations or damages over different periods.

4. **Forgery Detection:** Leverage the software to detect anomalies indicating potential forgeries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have the necessary hyperspectral data files (XRC, XRF) for the artwork you want to analyze.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
